## üìö Step-by-Step Contribution Guide

Follow these simple steps to make your first contribution:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Fork the Repository**
First, fork this repository. Once done, you'll be redirected to your GitHub account where you'll have your own copy of the repo.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone Your Forked Repository**
In your terminal, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Website-devxsphere.git
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Navigate into the Directory**
Move into the cloned directory:
```bash
cd Website-devxsphere
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Set the Upstream URL**
Before making any changes, set the upstream URL:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/DevXsphere/Website-devxsphere.git

# As a best practice, pull the latest changes before creating a new branch:
git pull upstream main --rebase
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Create a New Branch**
To avoid conflicts and follow best practices, create a new branch for your contribution:
```bash
# Replace <branch_name> with a meaningful name, e.g., add-feature, fix-issue.
git branch <branch_name>
git checkout <branch_name>
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Always make separate branches for each task and create PRs using those branches. Keeping the `main` branch clean is a great practice.

---

## üìÇ Adding Your Contribution

- **Step 1:** Make a directory with a meaningful name:
  ```bash
  mkdir <Dir_name>
  ```
- **Step 2:** Add your code, scripts, or project to the newly created directory.

   ```bash

   ```
3. **Push your branch to your GitHub repository:**

   git push origin <branch_name>
   ```

4. **Open a Pull Request:**
   - Navigate to your GitHub fork.
