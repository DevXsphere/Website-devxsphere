## 📚 Step-by-Step Contribution Guide

Follow these simple steps to make your first contribution:

### 1️⃣ **Fork the Repository**
First, fork this repository. Once done, you'll be redirected to your GitHub account where you'll have your own copy of the repo.

### 2️⃣ **Clone Your Forked Repository**
In your terminal, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Website-devxsphere.git
```

### 3️⃣ **Navigate into the Directory**
Move into the cloned directory:
```bash
cd Website-devxsphere
```

### 4️⃣ **Set the Upstream URL**
Before making any changes, set the upstream URL:
```bash

# As a best practice, pull the latest changes before creating a new branch:
git pull upstream main --rebase
```

### 5️⃣ **Create a New Branch**
To avoid conflicts and follow best practices, create a new branch for your contribution:
```bash
# Replace <branch_name> with a meaningful name, e.g., add-feature, fix-issue.
git branch <branch_name>
git checkout <branch_name>
```
